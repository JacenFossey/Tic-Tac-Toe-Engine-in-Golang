# Tic-Tac-Toe-in-Golang
A tic-tac-toe game with a simple Minimax AI implemented

I built this over a period of about a week, starting with first building a two-player tic tac toe game, then a minimax algorithm, and finally implementing the minimax into the game. 
I wrote this in Golang to improve my skills, and I'm happy to say it was very enjoyable!
